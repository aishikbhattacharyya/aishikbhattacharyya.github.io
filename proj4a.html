<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
	
In this assignment, I accomplished a lot of image handling and morphing via my face, Ryan Gosling’s face, and the faces of many random people on the Internet. From computing an affine transformation matrix to meticulously implementing inverse warping, the images below do a good job at morphing correspondences to create a new face!  

<h3 align="middle">Shoot the Pictures & Recovering Homographies</h3>
Here are some pictures from the rooftop of an apartment.

A homography is a 3x3 matrix which represents a transformation between a pair of images. We can recover a homography by using pairs of corresponding points. The points on the pictures above represent the corresponding points. To implement this function, I went through each pair of points and created a system of equations to obtain the homography matrix’s coefficients, of which there will be 9 values. I then solved it with a least squares solver and reshaped it into a 3x3 matrix.

<h3 align="middle">Warp the Images & Image Rectification</h3>
For this we use a function that takes in an image and a homography matrix. I define the image’s corners in the same order I took the points in for image rectification. I then warped those corners with the input homography matrix and calculated a bounding box for my resulting image. Then, I found all the values within the bounding box and applied the inverse homography matrix to them. Finally, I ran interpolation with griddata to achieve the final result. To get the images for rectification, I found images with rectangles and chose its destination coordinates to be an arbitrary value found in the caption of the images below. My image took very high resolution images that the code couldn’t process, so I resized my images, resulting in a little blurriness. This is reflected in the rectified images as well.
